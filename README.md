Normal, covid19, pneumonia classification using Deep learning
We develop a learning model that supports doctors with diagnosing illnesses that affect patients’ lungs. We have a set X-ray lung scans with examples of patients who had either pneumonia, Covid-19, or no illness. Using the Keras module, we will create a classification model that outputs a diagnosis based on a patient’s X-ray scan
